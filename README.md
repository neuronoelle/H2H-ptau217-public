# H2H-ptau217-public
Public version of codes

This depository contains the code for the statistical analyses in the paper by Warmenhoven et al. (2024): A comprehensive head-to-head comparison of plasma phosphorylated tau217 biomarker tests (_Brain_)

In order to get the required variables, e.g. the z-scored versions of the biomarkers, please run "H-2-H data alterations" first. 
You'll then find the scripts for the full sample analyses, as well as sub-sample analyses split by cognitive status. 
The replication in the Knight ADRC cohort and the supplementary analyses including the NULISA p-tau217 measurements can be found in separate files.
